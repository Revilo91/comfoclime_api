API Description for Zehnder ComfoClime 24/36 Airduino Interface

This is a documentation repository for the undocumented HTTP/JSON API of Zehnder ComfoClime 24 (Airduino/ESP32).

All data is transmitted unencrypted locally via HTTP interface from Zehnder ComfoClime App to the ComfoClime. Feel free to extend. If anyone has more information about ComfoClime sensor values and parameters, feel free to contact me.

A integration for Home Assistant using this interface is available at:
